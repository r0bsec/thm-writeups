## Clearing Tracks

This is a test machine. However, in a Red Team scenario, we could:

### Delete relevant logs from `/var/log/` - although that might draw attention.

> `rm -Rf /var/log/*`

### Search and replace our IP address in all logs via: 

> `find /var/log -name "*" -exec sed -i 's/10.10.2.14/127.0.0.1/g' {}\;`

### Wipe bash history for any accounts we used via: 

> `cat /dev/null > /root/.bash_history`
>  
> `cat /dev/null > /home/kathy/.bash_history`
>  
> `cat /dev/null > /home/sam/.bash_history`
